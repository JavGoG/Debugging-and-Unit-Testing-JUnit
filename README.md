# Debugging-and-Unit-Testing-JUnit-1
I wrote this code with the IDE Intellij, the code is compiled with Java 8. 
This application uses some clases and annotations from the JUnit 4 API, and it uses the JUnit 4 jupiter API to code some tests.
I followed the instructions of the teacher Tim Buchalka (Udemy, Java Programming Masterclass covering Java 11 and Java 17).

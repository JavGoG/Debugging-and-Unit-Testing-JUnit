# Debugging-and-Unit-Testing-JUnit-1
I wrote this code in Java 8 with the IDE Intellij. 
This application uses the JUnit 4 API (Classes and Annotations), as well as the JUnit 4 jupiter API to check some tests. I used a secondary branch to practice how to work with more developers. I followed the instructions of the teacher Tim Buchalka (Udemy, Java Programming Masterclass covering Java 11 and Java 17).
